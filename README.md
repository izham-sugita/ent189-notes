# ENT 189 Computer Programming

This repository is the collection of notes, tutorials and projects from ENT189 Computer Programming course. I taught the course from 2018-2020 as the main instructor for Mechanical Engineering Program. The course was originally developed for Mechatronic Engineering Program and taught to the Mechanical Engineering Program without any modification. That is why, if you are a Mechanical Engineering student, you might feel overwhelmed by the syllabus. However, I do think that you can enjoy the content as part of your learning experience. Besides, there is nothing wrong with learning as much as possible about C. It is an elegant programming language.
